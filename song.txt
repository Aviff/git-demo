one one one, little dog's run
two two two, cat's see you
thre thre thre, bid's is in a tree
four four four, cat's on the flour

----------------------------------
sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny
